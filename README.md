# WAFE, anti-WAFE, Comprehensive-WAFE

This repository is built to share the code and model weights for WAFE, anti-WAFE, and Comprehensive-WAFE models.
The design and experiment descriptions are summarized in the following papers.

Divergence vs. Convergence: What Do We Need?
--Substitutes for “Attention”

DOI 10.5281/zenodo.14241892

Abstract

This paper demonstrates that both similarity- and dissimilarity-weighted averages of features of elements (WAFE and anti-WAFE) in a sequence are effective for exchanging information among the elements. The paper also presents mean squared error and mean absolute error as effective substitutes for dot products in WAFE, effectively replacing the dot product-based "Attention" mechanism in Transformers.
